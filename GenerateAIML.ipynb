Using Microsoft One Drive, server shares (if you have one), or another cloud-based system means you’ll always have your documents available, should your hard disk one day pack in.

Moving your mouse around will have it back up and running. If that’s not the case, then click the power button on the monitor to see if it’s turned on.

Disconnect the video cable at the back of the computer to check that none of the pins are broken, bent or burnt. If they’re all fine, then plug the cable back in. Another cause of a distorted image, is if your monitor’s refresh rate isn’t properly set. Usually, this results in lines going across the monitor, or flickering. You can find this out by heading over to your Settings – just click the Start Button and select Settings if you’re working on Windows 10, or Action Centre on Windows 7. If you’re using a Mac, then click on Window, and then Settings. You should also check that there aren’t any magnetic devices such as fans or speakers directly by your screen, because a magnetic interference could cause a distorted image.</template></category><category><pattern>* STOP IMAGE SCREEN SKEWED DISTORT *</pattern><template><srai>STOP IMAGE SCREEN SKEWED DISTORT</srai></template></category><category><pattern>* STOP IMAGE SCREEN SKEWED DISTORT</pattern><template><srai>STOP IMAGE SCREEN SKEWED DISTORT</srai></template></category><category><pattern>STOP IMAGE SCREEN SKEWED DISTORT *</pattern><template><srai>STOP IMAGE SCREEN SKEWED DISTORT</srai></template></category><category><pattern>SIGNAL INPUT MESSAGE</pattern><template>A “no signal input” message appears when there is no image displayed from your PC to your monitor.

Clean your mouse with a sanitiser wipe and if it’s still acting erratically, then it’s likely to be defective and will need replacing. To confirm this, plug the mouse into a different computer to see if it behaves in the same way. It may be that the batteries need replacing, so it’s worth replacing them with new ones, to see if your mouse starts working again.</template></category><category><pattern>* MOUSE ACTING ERRATICALLY *</pattern><template><srai>MOUSE ACTING ERRATICALLY</srai></template></category><category><pattern>* MOUSE ACTING ERRATICALLY</pattern><template><srai>MOUSE ACTING ERRATICALLY</srai></template></category><category><pattern>MOUSE ACTING ERRATICALLY *</pattern><template><srai>MOUSE ACTING ERRATICALLY</srai></template></category><category><pattern>MOUSE KEYBOARD STOPPED WORKING</pattern><template>If your mouse or keyboard has stopped working, and it isn’t because it’s frozen, you’ll need to check that they’re connected properly.

However, you should only do this if there’s an issue with your computer and it won’t switch off. We would only advise this as a last resort, because it can cause issues such as data loss. Microsoft created the shut down feature to ensure that a computer goes through all the steps it needs to before turning off. That’s why if you just shut it down using the power button and then restart it, it comes up with a warning saying that your computer didn’t shut down properly.</template></category><category><pattern>* TURN WINDOW COMPUTER SHUT *</pattern><template><srai>TURN WINDOW COMPUTER SHUT</srai></template></category><category><pattern>* TURN WINDOW COMPUTER SHUT</pattern><template><srai>TURN WINDOW COMPUTER SHUT</srai></template></category><category><pattern>TURN WINDOW COMPUTER SHUT *</pattern><template><srai>TURN WINDOW COMPUTER SHUT</srai></template></category><category><pattern>PC SAFE MODE</pattern><template>Safe mode is used when there’s a system-critical problem that interferes with the normal operations of Windows, whilst still allowing it to load. You’ll want to turn safe mode on, so you can do some troubleshooting, and determine what the problem is. Your PC will work in safe mode, but will have limited functionality – you may experience screen resolution issues and won’t have internet access. For Windows 7 – 10 safe mode, press and hold F8 whilst the computer is starting. That should bring up the Windows Advanced Options Menu. Use the arrow key to move down to Safe Mode and then press Enter.</template></category><category><pattern>* PC SAFE MODE *</pattern><template><srai>PC SAFE MODE</srai></template></category><category><pattern>* PC SAFE MODE</pattern><template><srai>PC SAFE MODE</srai></template></category><category><pattern>PC SAFE MODE *</pattern><template><srai>PC SAFE MODE</srai></template></category><category><pattern>MAC SAFE MODE</pattern><template>Safe mode works the same way for Macs as it does for Windows: also referred to as safe boot, it enables you to start your Mac so it can perform checks, whilst preventing certain software from automatically opening. To start your Mac in safe mode, press and hold the shift key as soon as you turn it on. The Apple logo will appear and then you’ll see the login window: at this point, you can release the shift key. To leave safe mode, just restart your Mac.</template></category><category><pattern>* MAC SAFE MODE *</pattern><template><srai>MAC SAFE MODE</srai></template></category><category><pattern>* MAC SAFE MODE</pattern><template><srai>MAC SAFE MODE</srai></template></category><category><pattern>MAC SAFE MODE *</pattern><template><srai>MAC SAFE MODE</srai></template></category><category><pattern>VIRUS MAC</pattern><template>Unfortunately, it’s a myth that Macs are bulletproof against cyber-attacks, and they can get viruses.

If your connection isn’t the issue, then check your email server isn’t encountering any issues – if that’s the case, you’ll need to call us. Another common cause of not being able to send or receive emails, is if your emails are set to the offline mode. Reconnecting is simple: just click on the Send/Receive tab, and check if the Work Offline button is shaded. If so, you will need to click it to get your email back online.</template></category><category><pattern>* SEND RECEIVE EMAIL *</pattern><template><srai>SEND RECEIVE EMAIL</srai></template></category><category><pattern>* SEND RECEIVE EMAIL</pattern><template><srai>SEND RECEIVE EMAIL</srai></template></category><category><pattern>SEND RECEIVE EMAIL *</pattern><template><srai>SEND RECEIVE EMAIL</srai></template></category><category><pattern>UNABLE RECEIVE EMAIL ATTACHMENT</pattern><template> If your inbox is full, then you won’t be able to receive any attachments that are sent, so the first step is to delete any emails you no longer need. If you’re not receiving attachments because your inbox is full, then the sender will usually receive a notification, so they’re aware you haven’t received it. Alternatively, the sender may have attached a file that’s too big, which is why you can’t receive it. You may also be using security software such as Mimecast, which will quarantine any spam or suspicious looking emails. Take a look at your On Hold or Junk messages to see if your emails have been blocked under one of these policies.</template></category><category><pattern>* UNABLE RECEIVE EMAIL ATTACHMENT *</pattern><template><srai>UNABLE RECEIVE EMAIL ATTACHMENT</srai></template></category><category><pattern>* UNABLE RECEIVE EMAIL ATTACHMENT</pattern><template><srai>UNABLE RECEIVE EMAIL ATTACHMENT</srai></template></category><category><pattern>UNABLE RECEIVE EMAIL ATTACHMENT *</pattern><template><srai>UNABLE RECEIVE EMAIL ATTACHMENT</srai></template></category><category><pattern>FIX PAPER JAM</pattern><template> If the paper has jammed, then the first thing you need to do is turn the printer off. If you can visibly see the paper, then manually remove it – being careful you don’t tear it. You should also open the printer door to see if there is any more paper that’s stuck inside. Once you’ve removed all of it, you should be able to turn the printer back on and use it again.
